# Emulator.JS Embed SWF Emu
An easily embeddable url-query based page for Emulator.JS

## Why?
Emulator.JS is great, however sometimes you want it in an iFrame. If any of the developers want me to take this down I will. Love your work!

## Test.NES
Many thanks to tsone for creating the 2048 test.nes rom. The sources are available as part of neskit project in https://bitbucket.org/tsone/neskit/ where sources are in examples/2048/ directory.
