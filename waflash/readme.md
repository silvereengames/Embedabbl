# WAFlash Embed SWF Emu

An easily embeddable url-query based page for the WAFlash Flash Emulator.

## Why?
WAFlash is great but setting up to just put a simple swf on your web page can be slightly annoying.
So, I've made the whole process as easy as making an iframe.

## Setup
Using this is as easy as just making an iframe with your swf in it!

### Working example
```html
  <iframe width="800px" height="600px" src="https://embedabbl.zombienw.com/waflash/index.html?swf=https://embedabbl.zombienw.com/ruffle/test.swf" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```
